# escape room secret agent database prop

Are you an evil genius in need of an app to run your criminal organization?  
Well, this isn't the solutionâ€”but until you build your own super-intelligent evil supercomputer, this will complete the look!



## Installation

- Requires [blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) to be installed.
- To install dependencies, run:
    ```bash
    pip install blessed
    ```



## Usage

This program is part of an escape room game. The user "searches" for words; if a word is defined as a valid input, it will "find" a result paired to that search term.

- Designed to be run in a Linux terminal.
- Works perfectly in `xterm`; `cool-retro-term` also looks nice.
- **Note:** Can't actually launch nukes.
