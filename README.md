# escape room secret agent database prop

Are you an evil genious and need an app to run your criminal organization? 
Well, this isn't the solution, but until you build your own super inteligent evil supercomuter, this will complete the look

## notes
- this program is a part of an escape room game, the user "searches" for words, if it is defined as a valid input, it will "find" a result paired to that search term.

- this program is designed to be ran in linux terminal. xterm works perfect, cool-retro-term looks also nice.

- can't actually lauch nukes
